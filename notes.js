/*This is the notes for js

The const keyword is used to declare the constant.
Prefer let keyword to create a variable rather than var becase the var has scope problem just like a global variable in C++.

Type conversion:
Use classes such as Number(),String(), Boolean() to convert to respective data types.
"33"=>33
"sanklapa"=>NaN
null=>0
1=>true
0=>false
"sankalpa"=>true
""=>false
